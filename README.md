## Features


**ECC**: Uses well established *Elliptic Curve Cryptography*'s curve *p256* (that is as secure as RSA, while having a smaller footprint).

**De-/Encrypt**: Enables simple encryption and decryption with *AES128*.

**Keys**: Perform *Diffie-Hellman*'s key exchange using *X9.63 SHA256* algorithm. Additionally
convert keys back and forth between bytes and Apple's `SecKey` format.

**Random**: Create pseudo-random bytes for cryptographic functions or as unique IDs.

**Signatures**: Create and verify *Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm* (ECDSA) *X9.62 SHA256* or *HMAC* signatures.


## Installation

The package can be installed
by adding `hm_crypto` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:hm_crypto, github: "highmobility/hmkit-crypto-elixir", tag: "v2.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Requirements

HmCrypto Elixir requires Elixir 1.8 or later and is compatible with apps targeting Erlang 21.0 or above.
